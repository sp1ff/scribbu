Documentation
-------------

scribbu is a C++ library & associated command-line tool for working
with ID3 tags. It was born when I retired my last Windows machine &
could no longer use Winamp to manage my library of digital music. It
is very crude presently; I'm building it out as I discover features I
want.

I got the project name from this cool project name
[http://mrsharpoblunto.github.io/foswig.js/](generator).

You can generate doxygen docs by cd'ing to doc & typing 'make doxygen-doc'
