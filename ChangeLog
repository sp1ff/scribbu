	Support scribbu on MacOS.
	scribbu is now buulding on MacOS (Darwin 18.20.0) using clang (i.e.
	the native toolchain; *not* GNU gcc).

2018-12-07  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Initial commit of scribbu 0.5.
	This commit adds a few minor updates.

2018-04-01  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Final 0.4 commit on the `find' feature branch.
	This will be the final commit on the `find' feature branch. It
	includes boilerplate updates, updates to NEWS, ChangeLog &c.

	Corrected the behavior of --help on a few sub-commands.

2018-03-28  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Documentation update.

2018-03-24  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Scheme support update.
	Cleared out a number of TODOs in scheme.cc; revamped write-tag
	& added replace-tags.

	Also cleared out TODOs in the codebase altogether preparatory
	to merging this branch.

2018-03-17  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Boilerplate update.
	This commit looks large, but other than whitespace the changes are
	all to comments/boilerplate. My first run of `bp.py' resulted in:

	  - stripping trailing whitespace in all files

	  - adding standard headers to nearly all project files

	  - standardizing the version, author name & e-mail throughout
	    configure.ac, documentation & file headers

2018-03-17  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Finally split up 'RockTheJoint'.
	I used scribbu to cut up a large file I'd ripped from a stream;
	this involved a number of changes:

	1. adding a few external functions

	2. modifying classes comment & user_defined_text to have ctors
	   for use other than when deserializing

	3. added a unit test for all this new logic

	4. Fixed an error where Guile warning about source being newer
	   than compiled would erroneously cause tests to be marked as
	   failed.

	5. Customized the welcome message when running the REPL.

	6. Standardized boilerplate such as version & license terms.

2018-01-21  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Documentation updates & minor autoconf changes.
	Moved man pages to `doc' sub-directory; added Info, as well (skeletal).
	Changed the Guile macros I use in `configure.ac' while trying
	(unsuccessfully) to get scribbu to build on MacOS.

2018-01-18  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Fix parsing ID3v2.4 tags with extended headers.
	Audacity exports tracks with ID3v2.4 tags containing extended
	headers. Since this is the first example I've come across of
	this particular ID3v2 tag, it was the first time I was able to
	exercise that code path in scribbu. Unsurprisingly, there were
	mutliple issues. This commit fixes them.

2018-01-15  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Improve scribbu documentation preparatory to an update.
	This commit includes several improvements to scribbu's documentation:

	1. man pages for scribbu and all sub-commands

2018-01-01  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Corrected some assumptions regarding endianness & sizeof(size_t).

2017-12-29  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	`test-cleanup-encoded-by' passing.
	Now scripting scribbu from Scheme to update tags!

2017-12-28  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Mutability complete.
	Re-implemented serialization. Tests for compression & unsynchronisation
	added. Unit tests passing. `make distcheck' passes.

2017-12-25  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Miscellaneous bug fixes.

2017-12-10  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Yet more ID3v2 mutability.
	This commit completely revamps ID3v2.{2,3,4} size computation,
	serialization & unsynchronisation. Honestly, it's been so long since
	I've committed that I've forgotten everything that went into this
	commit.

	There is more work to be done on adding mutability, but the unit
	test suite, at least, passes.

2017-08-24  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	More ID3v2 mutability.
	This commit completes my first use case for tag mutability-- I can
	now, in Scheme, walk a directory of tagged files, find those with
	an ID3v1 comment of 'Ripped by Winamp...' and update the encoded-by
	ID3v2 frame.

	It is also my first commit integrating Guile into my autotools
	setup.

	There is still more work to be done, esp. in implementing mutability
	in all ID3v2 tags.

2017-08-02  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Making ID3v2 tags mutable.
	This commit marks the successful completion of what began as an
	experiment to make id3v2_2_tag mutable, primarily through a
	container-liker interface to its frames. I say container-like because
	its mutable iterator dereferences to a proxy object (like bit_vector)
	that can handle assignments & moves while keeping the tag's ancillary
	datastructures consistent.

	After this commit, I will merge this branch back into the 'find'
	feature branch, extend mutability to the other tags & resume implementing
	Scheme support for editing tags.

2017-07-22  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Mutable tags work-in-progress.
	This is an intermediate check-in for my work on making ID3v2 tags
	mutable. It contains:

	    1. A first, very crude implementation of mutable iterators for
		   ID3v2.2 tags

	    2. Skeletal implementations for new size(), needs_unsync() &
		   serialization support.

	    3. Working unit tests.

2017-07-04  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	First implementations of foreign types & functions.
	This commit contains my first, tentative, foreign functions & types
	in Guile. I'm committing preparatory to pulling an experimental branch
	for modifying tags (as opposed from simply reading them, as scribbu
	has done until now).

2017-06-10  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Integrated with Guile.
	This commit integrates Guile into scribbu. Running just 'scribbu'
	will start up the Scheme interpreter. 'scribbu -e' & 'scribbu -f'
	invokes stub functions.

2017-06-08  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Update compiler & Vagrant box.
	This commit upgrades the Vagrant box to Ubuntu 16, g++ to
	version 6, and boost to version 1.61. This involved a lot of
	code tweaks, especially around operator<< & operator>>.

2017-06-07  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Minor housekeeping.
	Moved README :=> README.md, added autogen.sh.

2017-06-02  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Pre-merge commit.
	Updated README, NEWS & ChangeLog. Turned off automatic core dumps.
	Ready to merge.

2017-06-01  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Doc updates.
	(Very) minor updates to scribbu documentation.

2017-05-29  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	More testing...
	This commit adds more unit tests; especially some lifted
	from the taglib test suite.

2017-05-27  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Added unit tests.
	Small commit adding a few more unit tests.

2017-05-26  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Continued test improvement.
	Added tests, fixed:

	    1. multiple ID3v2 tags in a file
	    2. corrupt/incorrectly written ID3v2 tag
	    3. multiple bugs in the 'dump' sub-command
	    4. POPM bug-- had ID PCNT

2017-05-24  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	More code cleanup.
	This commit does two things:

	    1. Cleared up most of the TODO comments (exceptions & test-
	       related stuff excepted)
	    2. Fixed bugs in reading track data & ID3v1 tags where the
	       stream state wasn't being checked.

2017-05-23  sp1ff  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Ongoing improvements to the 'dump' branch.
	This commit does a few things:

	    1. Improves the 'dump' sub-command to handle directory trees

	    2. Fixes a few bugs I found trying to dump my entire .mp3 collection

	    3. Finished implementing the pretty printer

	    4. Cleaned up a slew of "TODO" comments throughout the codebase

	Unfortunately, I'm on battery in a plane over the middle of the Pacific
	ocean right now, so I'm committing without going through my entire
	C/L. Specifically, I didn't run 'make distcheck' & I didn't generate
	docs (I *did* run 'make check').

2017-05-21  sp1ff  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Fixed a few bugs & added doxygen.
	This commit fixes a few bugs that came up:

	    1. Permitted multiple copies of text frames in ID3v2 tags

	    2. Trimmed trailing spaces in convert_encoding

	It also adds doxygen support to my autotools configuration.

2017-05-19  sp1ff  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Committing the 'dump' sub-command.
	This commit adds the 'dump' sub-command, which turned out to be
	considerably more complex than I'd anticipated. There are still a
	lot of "TODO" comments in the code, and the code base needs to be
	more thoroughly tested overall.

2017-04-16  Michael Herstine  <sp1ff@pobox.com>

	Tweak the sub-command structure & get 'distcheck' working.
	This commit does two things:

	1. Replaced the 'command' enum with a static auto-register approach,
	which allowed me to remove some code.

	2. Got "make distcheck" working; I had to:

	  a) use BUILT_SOURCES to tell automake that the lexer header file
	     was required & tell it how to make it
	  b) include all my test data in the distribution tarball
	  c) rename several files therein to remove spaces, which automake
	     can't handle

2016-06-12  Michael Herstine  <mgh@Saramac.local>
