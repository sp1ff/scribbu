Documentation
-------------

scribbu is a C++ library & associated command-line tool for working
with ID3 tags. It was born when I retired my last Windows machine &
could no longer use Winamp to manage my library of digital music. It
is very crude presently; it can only read tags and do things with that
information like report on them or rename files based on them.

I got the project name from the cool project name generator at
http://mrsharpoblunto.github.io/foswig.js/.
